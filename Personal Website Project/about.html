    <p class="blurb">Delish Photography is a styling and photography studio that focuses on making food and drinks look delectable. Launched in 2017, the New York City-based group has created ad campaigns for various brands, worked with magazing editors to give their editorials a matching visual feast, and helped various clients and restaurateurs show off their edible creations in the best possible light. Our goal is to make mouths water through amazing photography and food styling. If a picture is worth a thousand words, we want ours to say nothing but "YUM."<br><br>
    With 25 photographers and 15 stylists on board, there's nothing our team can't handle. Have a last-minute opportunity for that editorial ad? Leave it to us to not only meet the deadline, but also make it seem like we had months to work on getting the perfect shot. It's a bold statement, but then we've never been in the business of backing down from a challenge.
